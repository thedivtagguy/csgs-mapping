      facilitated identity formation, intersectional activism, and cultural expression. This archive\r
      bridges the research gap in queer digital presence as highlighted by Shahani (2008),\r

      artistic expression. Judith Butler (1988) refers to gender as a social construct that demands\r
      behavioral performance conditioning and repetitions. We have examined and theorized how\r
      performance serves as a space for deconstructing and reconstructing gender. In an interview\r
      with the team, the contemporary Launda Naach performer Swaja translated their taken name as\r

      recklessness; teasing, and teetering between play and fight. This notion of recklessness\r
      aligns with Arondekar\u2019s (2023) concept of abundance\u2014a framework that invites a rethinking of\r
