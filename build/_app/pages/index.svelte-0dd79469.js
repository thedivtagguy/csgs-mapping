The trial court concluded that the girl was a minor i.e. below 16 years of age and the consent was taken by the misconception of marrying her, convicted the accused and sentenced rigorous imprisonment of 10 years. However, the case was moved to the apex court. The victim was offered a compensational amount both for her and her daughter born out of the act. The appellant was acquitted, as the conviction by the trial court and the high court was set aside. The issues were subdued by the judges with their explanations as the victim was well aware they are of different caste\u2019s yet she gave her consent for intercourse based on the promise of marriage.

the solution to the lack of right to matrimonial property lies in changing laws in that area. It is not a sufficient reason to curtail divorce.

the solution to the lack of right to matrimonial property lies in changing laws in that area. It is not a sufficient reason to curtail divorce.
