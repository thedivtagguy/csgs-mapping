"Sex in the city
by Indu Harikumar",Immersive Multimedia Performance,Not mentioned ," Sex in the City is an immersive multimedia performance that blends personal narrative, illustration, and live performance to explore themes of gender, sexuality, and body politics. Created by Indu Harikumar, this powerful piece invites audiences to not just watch, but to actively participate in a collective exploration of pleasure, consent, vulnerability, and gender-based violence. Drawing from eight years of research, the performance culminates in a shared dance experience, fostering a sense of release and connection among all participants.
","The initial poster for ""Sex in the City"" itself is a powerful political statement. Its bold colors, suggestive imagery, and the figure sprawled confidently in a public space challenge societal norms and expectations around gender, sexuality, and public behavior. This provocative image directly engages with the ongoing debate about public and private spaces, questioning who has the right to occupy them and how. The interactive nature of the performance, where the audience becomes part of the experience and explores bodily themes and emotions with the performer, further amplifies its political significance by blurring the lines between performer and spectator and challenging traditional notions of theater.

By reclaiming the derogatory term ""Raanti which means barbarian,"" the performance celebrates the raw, untamed aspects of femininity often suppressed. Through powerful, embodied movement, it invites audiences to witness the transformative power of authentic self-expression and to reflect on societal pressures that often limit women's freedom to express their emotions fully.










","The installation's photo images truly captivated me with their movement, moment, and powerful message. Diverse female bodies, adorned in vibrantly unconventional clothing, took center stage in a unique performance.

",90 Minutes ,"Bhaagi Hui Ladkiyaan is a theatrical exploration of the lives of four young Muslim women residing in Nizamuddin Basti. The play delves into their daily struggles, aspirations, and the complex interplay between their private and public identities. The women, through physical theater and storytelling, confront societal expectations, gender roles, and the limitations of their domestic spaces. By shedding their veils and embracing their true selves, they challenge traditional norms and seek liberation in the outside world. The play ultimately highlights the tension between self-perception and external judgment, as the women navigate the complexities of their identities within their community. ","The play is fluid in essence, with actors sharing personal stories each time the narration changes related to current issues surrounding gender norms, sexuality, freedom, and dreams. They incorporate the lived experiences of intersectional identities like religion, gender, class, and region, bringing voices from the ground level. By using everyday essentials such as toothpaste, bras, and mugs, the play reflects on the idea of the mundane items but gendered. This play in its core challenges the traditional notion of theater as an art form, blurring the lines between audience and artist where the performer constantly and consiously intreact with the audience . The audience's interactive elements throughout the play are particularly striking, culminating in a powerful finale where they invited on the satge and put the spark paper where they feel resonating with personal narratives of the artist navigating gender, religion, and class identities while navigating Nizamuddin mohalla and symbolises that a part of you in the Nizamuddin space. Using veil as a prop and symbol to blurr the idea of public and private. In between the play artist use silence as a tool for reflection and communication which highlights the importance and relevance of time.

Through dance, Laksha the transwoman artist navigates the tension between their personal desires and societal expectations. The film showcases their unique dance style, blending contemporary and traditional Indian dance forms.

""Our production ""FAR... WITHIN"" is a dance film by Laksha Dantran. The film takes the perspective of a transwoman who has a great dream: she sees the journey of creation, human life, and society.

Queen Size (2016) | Mandeep Raikhy,Dance,45 minutes,"Choreographed by Mandeep Raikhy, it is an exploration - in response to article 377 - that took the form of a detailed study of the intimacy and lovemaking between two men. Played out on a charpoy, the duet examined the nuts and bolts – carnal, mechanical and emotional – of a close encounter between two male bodies. In deliberately making this encounter visible, Queen-size posed questions around spectatorship, privacy and dissent. ","Firstly, the performance runs in a continuous 45-minute loop, allowing the audience to enter and leave the space as they wish, from different angles. It is reported to have caused a 'shift' in many peoples' perspectives - after watching it. It is strongly non-durational and non-linear.

A Male Ant Has Straight Antenna (2015) | Mandeep Raikhy,Dance,53 minutes,"This is an ensemble dance performance publicly questioning various notions of masculinity - through the use of games, movement and touch. In an arena-like setting, bodies move around, playing with masculinity in different ways. It thus challenges myopic perspectives on the male body - and its orientations. Both male and female bodies move, contort and question this central quandary - in interesting, yet disturbing ways.  
","Following the Nirbhaya case of 2012, this piece of Raikhy emerged in response to ideas of gender hierarchy in the capital. Through this, Mandeep also seems to be exploring his own ideas of male bodies and masculinity; between hyper-expressive and effeminate ones. There's satire, abstraction and play - and Raikhy is able to use movement to describe what he can't with words. Bodies are explored, contorted, moved in different ways, singular and duet-based. What makes this unique and radical is this very subversion of body - through synchronic, abstract and radical movements - that makes the performance hard to define. 'A Male Ant' is queer in how it plays around with form and content quite effectively - and puts the audience at ease.

Asexuality is often doubly marginalised in a discourse that sexualises the queer body in the name of visibility. In a society deeply conditioned about who, how and why to desire, the question of what kind of desire or why even desire falls from between the cracks. This poem queers the heteronormative definitions of sex and romance, making both subjective to identity or being, as the poet claims her right to romance simultaneous to the right to dissociate with conventional sexuality.

When Tara (the female-bodied sibling) struggles with disability, the parents and doctor make medical decisions for her dictated by their patrairchal notions of gendered bodies. By doing away with child or young-adult actors, the director highlights the absurdity of robbed agencies and guardianship. Unconventional for plays, the actors read from scripts on stage.","The manner in which the same play has been enacted in different reimaginings is deeply fascinating. In this rendition, the interplay of disability and gender have been highlighted through moments of dark humour and vulnerability displayed by the young disabled girl who struggled to meet the standards of a female and feminine body. The appearance and characterisation of Tara's character in the play is subtly queered. She is juxtaposed against a friend of hers who appears on stage dressed in a bright pink dress and a sympathetic disposition towards disability. Tara's disinterest and discomfort in a body constantly burdered with expectations of 'femininity' is expressed through dialogues and body language. The directorial choice to have actors read from scripts seems to be satire on a society that indeed seems to be reading from a prescribed text of heteronormativity and patriarchy.

Scenes such as that comprising of Bhagar Singh sitting on a stool with his legs apart and straight and hands resting on the stool in the middle while delivering a monologue to the audience showcases a level of informality and playfulness that is seldom allowed in his interpretation of youth. Focus on the fact that Bhagat Singh had asked for a romantic saga, 'Heer-Ranjha' during his time behind bars and moreover, has sworn on it instead of the sacred books before being executed, is an indictment of love that is seldom allowed penetration in his accounts of bravery and patriotism.
