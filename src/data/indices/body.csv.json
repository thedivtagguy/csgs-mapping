The performer uses physical theatre as his medium of expression and makes his body the fulcrum of this solo drama. ","rationale":"Akin to most performances by. Navtej Johar, queerness functions in the undercurrents of the performance. Elaborate scenes such as that of him wearing the turban stretch through over five minutes, hinting to the performative process of 'becoming' a figure. The performance makes unconventional use of the body through strenuously slow floorwork. The conventionally hyper-masculine figure is enacted by Navtej Johar with a humanising fluidity. Scenes such as that comprising of Bhagar Singh sitting on a stool with his legs apart and straight and hands resting on the stool in the middle while delivering a monologue to the audience showcases a level of informality and playfulness that is seldom allowed in his interpretation of youth. Focus on the fact that Bhagat Singh had asked for a romantic saga, 'Heer-Ranjha' during his time behind bars and moreover, has sworn on it instead of the sacred books before being executed, is an indictment of love that is seldom allowed penetration in his accounts of bravery and patriotism.

Kundi mat khadkaao raja, seedha andar aao raja\" - 'Voh Ladkiyon Wala Naatak', Instagram.","rationale":"The play, which is still a running show features women in varying cultural contexts in moments of vulnerability and celebration. Their social media, which comprises of montages from the play and rehearsals set to well-known Hindi item numbers, reclaim sexuality. Through characters such as the flirtatious maid, they also manage to politicise marginalised bodies and their access to sexuality. Through the course of the play, they dorn varying avatars, including clowns, nightmares, mohalla aunties, mothers, maids, and more. As they embody the varyingly human, material and abstract, boundaries of all kinds are overstepped, including that of gender. Moreover, they succeed in telling stories of and from all spectrums of society. A review writes \"I dont remember the last time I saw women laugh like this, both on and off-stage. Come with your notebooks, they're redefining womanhood\".
