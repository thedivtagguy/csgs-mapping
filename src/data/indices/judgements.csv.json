Therefore, I find that, in view of the judgment of the Apex Court in National Legal MSM,J WP_16770_2019 Services Authority vs Union of India (referred supra), the State is under obligation to provide only vertical reservations, but the percentage of reservations is not specified in the judgment. Therefore, it is appropriate to issue direction to the State to undertake study on the problems faced by transgenders, while holding that the reservation as directed by the Supreme Courtis only vertical and making provision for horizontal reservation based on sex or gender is contrary to the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the judgment of the Apex Court in National Legal Services Authority vs Union of India (referred supra) ex facie.
