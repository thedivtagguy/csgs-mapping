1,Hum Jinns by Tirana Sengupta,"
Fusion of Bharatnatyam and urdu poetry
A project led by a poet, a dancer, and two filmmakers
",,Classical Dance,"
5 Minutes 27 Seconds","The performance ""Hum Jinns Parast,"" an Urdu phrase meaning embodying multiple identities or spirits, is a collaborative work by Maniza Khalid (poet), Tirna Sengupta (dancer), Ghania Siddiqui (director), and Talat Shakeel (sound designer). This piece explores the complex layers of identity within individuals and their efforts to reconcile them. The artists delve into the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals in a society where their identities are frequently marginalized. Words such as khabeeth, haram, besharami, and behudgi—terms used in Islamic culture to label and dehumanize LGBTQ+ individuals—are employed, while the performance broadens its scope to address society as a whole, not limited to any single religion. Through dance, music, and personal narratives, the creators challenge cultural norms and seek to redefine what it means to be ""normal."" 





","The artist challenges fixed boundaries within the performing arts by, for instance, performing Bharatnatyam on a terrace without classical music, thereby questioning the current political segregation of languages based on religion and region. The fusion of Urdu and Bharatnatyam is both unique and serves as a political statement against the polarization of the art form and its internal hierarchy. Through Urdu poetry and dancing to the rhythm of spoken words, sound in the film is used to explore and question how the Muslim community and society at large view the LGBTQ+ community.",Urdu+dance+challenging the religion+fusion+folks dance,religion,Fusion,Interactive,"Hum Jinns

Bharatnatyam, storytelling with modern music",,Classical Dance,6 Minutes 19 Seconds,"This performance centers on a female body who defies societal expectations, experiencing love, abuse, and resilience. In the video, the artist performs Bharatnatyam in a public space, blending poetry with storytelling forms. The artist dedicates this work to those who choose love over identities of caste, class, religion, and region, also addressing same-sex love within these stories. Through storytelling, the piece explores love in all its forms and how society uses violence and sectarianism to suppress it. This story is not limited to the experiences of cisgender women but also examines how rigid, violent, and unequal gender norms impact marginalized identities.






","Performing Bharatnatyam in a public space, rather than in an auditorium, challenged the set norms of how certain arts should be viewed. This piece makes the art form more accessible to the general public. The interaction between the artist and the audience was fascinating for us- esp the way in which the audience of mostly young males from the community stare at the performer with curiosity and the artist with her art look back to them with questions, in a funny way, weirdly. Yet, the woman artist is occupying and reclaiming public space and while also sharing her experience through conversation with her friend.

In the end,  many people join the artist and dance on the song which goes beyond sexualization and satirizes the government creating a sense of community. Historically this folk art form has been perfromed by oppressed caste people and the name change from naach to launda naach is a strategy used by the upper castes and classes of Bhojpuri society to demean a popular folk tradition associated with marginalized communities. This renaming, along with the substitution of 'Bidesiya' for Naach, serves to both stigmatize the art form and erase its complex themes of social critique.",Breaking boundaries+folk dance+poetry+ folks dance and urdu fusion+diverse expression,humour,interactive,regional,Launda Naach by Rakesh Kumar,Space
4,कव्वाल साहब के पसीने छूट गए नाज़ वारसी से मुकाबला करने मे-Naaz Warsi Vs Rizwan Jafri, Qawwali Muqabla ,,Music,18 minutes 21 seconds ,"In a captivating qawwali competition, Naaz Warsi, a female qawwal, faced off against Rizwan Jafri, a male qawwal. The performance, held before a predominantly male audience, challenged traditional gender roles and expectations. The qawwals sang passionately about love in its various forms, and breaking the traditional form of sufi songs they are doing shayari in between. A captivating jugalbandi, or musical duet, between the two showcases their exceptional skills. Naaz Warsi's vibrant attire makes her stand out in the crowd, captivating the audience. The performance serves as a powerful platform for challenging traditional norms and promoting inclusivity through the art of qawwali.","This performance challenges the exclusionary practices prevalent in dargah spaces, where hereditary learning often restricts access to women and non-inherited performers. The outright prohibition of women Qawwals from performing at traditional sites is a systemic issue enforced through a code of conduct dictated by the heads of the shrine. This political rationale underscores the importance of their performances as a means to challenge patriarchal norms and demand equal opportunities for women in the qawwali tradition. By performing in unconventional settings and asserting their right to be heard, these artists are contributing to a broader movement towards greater inclusivity and gender equality within the cultural landscape.

The play delves into their daily struggles, aspirations, and the complex interplay between their private and public identities. The women, through physical theater and storytelling, confront societal expectations, gender roles, and the limitations of their domestic spaces. By shedding their veils and embracing their true selves, they challenge traditional norms and seek liberation in the outside world. The play ultimately highlights the tension between self-perception and external judgment, as the women navigate the complexities of their identities within their community. ","The play is fluid in essence, with actors sharing personal stories each time the narration changes related to current issues surrounding gender norms, sexuality, freedom, and dreams. They incorporate the lived experiences of intersectional identities like religion, gender, class, and region, bringing voices from the ground level. By using everyday essentials such as toothpaste, bras, and mugs, the play reflects on the idea of the mundane items but gendered. This play in its core challenges the traditional notion of theater as an art form, blurring the lines between audience and artist where the performer constantly and consiously intreact with the audience . The audience's interactive elements throughout the play are particularly striking, culminating in a powerful finale where they invited on the satge and put the spark paper where they feel resonating with personal narratives of the artist navigating gender, religion, and class identities while navigating Nizamuddin mohalla and symbolises that a part of you in the Nizamuddin space.

","The initial poster for ""Sex in the City"" itself is a powerful political statement. Its bold colors, suggestive imagery, and the figure sprawled confidently in a public space challenge societal norms and expectations around gender, sexuality, and public behavior. This provocative image directly engages with the ongoing debate about public and private spaces, questioning who has the right to occupy them and how.

17,Akshayambara (2015) | Sharanya Ramprakash & Dramanon,Play | Kannada,,Theatre,90 minutes,"Directed by Sharanya Ramprakash, this Kannada play by Dramanon Theatre discusses how female sexuality remains a subject that has yet to gain traction. An experimental work that premiered in 2015, it deals with the construct of gender performance - and shows how a male artist in streevesha plays Draupadi while in a tradition-defying move, a woman is cast as the Pradhana Purushavesha of Kaurava. What happens to the interpretation of gender when a man plays the streevesha and the purushavesha is played by a woman? Who is the real woman and who is the real man? The play uses the form of Yakshagana as well as ‘modern’ theatrical methods that interrogate the idea of representation of the female body, and consequently the notion of ownership. ","The play strikes a beautiful conversation around bodies, female sexuality and the inversion of gender roles in Yakshagana. It supports what is increasingly a bigger presence of women artists in the dance form. Moreover, Akshayambara’s set includes a Yakshagana stage as well as a green room, both of which are onstage. Both these aspects are big reasons for why this can be selected as a 'queer' performance. The play’s narrative moves between stage and greenroom - and between vesha (costume) and vastava (reality) - thus raising questions to the spectator and their role in the play.

","Following the Nirbhaya case of 2012, this piece of Raikhy emerged in response to ideas of gender hierarchy in the capital. Through this, Mandeep also seems to be exploring his own ideas of male bodies and masculinity; between hyper-expressive and effeminate ones. There's satire, abstraction and play - and Raikhy is able to use movement to describe what he can't with words. Bodies are explored, contorted, moved in different ways, singular and duet-based. What makes this unique and radical is this very subversion of body - through synchronic, abstract and radical movements - that makes the performance hard to define.

Deeply evocative in nature, it is arguably about the author's queer journey, shown through wacking (dance) in a flower-styled costume - meant to signify 'growth' over time. It is about undoing the limitations and insecurities 'lined' within a body: and blooming in a new way, like a flower. ","Skanky and alternative in nature, it features avant-garde forms of makeup by the artist - and envisions body horror/fantasy in a new way; it is the latter element that possibly separates it from 'usual' drag. Like many drag shows that present queer or trans subjectivities in new ways, Artrysis's particular performance also does this in a playful yet disturbing way. Experimental and performance art in nature, it creates a beautiful blend of interesting form, props, makeup and dance. It is drag that horrors, astounds yet makes one think as an audience.

","Similar to the Ramleela productions in Northern India, 'Bhavai' is a form of community theatre and entertainment in rural Gujarat. This particular performance is an enactment of a popular Gujarati movie 'Machhu Tara Vehta Pani' which portrays the 1979 breakage of the Macchhu dam in Morbi. This performance portrays the disaster, its aftermath and connection to the spiritual goddess associated with that river through dramatic conversations, music and dance. ","As men dressed in chaniya-choli create humor at the expense of men dressed in all-black, donning long moustaches and paghdis, subversion of a more obvious kind takes place. It is interesting to view couples in this Bhavai imitate behaviors of conventionalised heteronormative married couples, almost reimagining marriage's mundanity as an institution welcoming queerness. However, it is the unconventional act of re-enacting a movie for audiences who wouldn't commonly have access to cinema is what makes the form of the performance as queer as the identities involved. Doubling down the performance’s amphibian nature, the occasion of performance itself has been organized in honour of a goddess (see the photo placed in the video).

The poetry of the song speaks in defense of a relationship that the society forbids, it dismisses the voyeuring social morality that passes judgement on them. As conveyed by the conversational expressions of the singer, the song is sung as though flirting with the lover. Simultaneously, it becomes our entry wound into the fascinating relationship Gujarati folk music has had with gender performance.

It is penned in an intimate first person voice and speaks to the beloved. In playful but determined pride, the lover rejects a world that calls them mad and tells his beloved 'let them keep their delusions'. The song brims with hope as the lovers dream about a future together.

She is juxtaposed against a friend of hers who appears on stage dressed in a bright pink dress and a sympathetic disposition towards disability. Tara's disinterest and discomfort in a body constantly burdered with expectations of 'femininity' is expressed through dialogues and body language.

""I perform my Bharathanatyam to imagine new regimes of mobility and equity for women like me from the hereditary families that are the original custodians of the bharathanatyam tradition. A large part of this has to do with the retrieval – through largely oral sources– of dance repertoire of historical import that was created by and for my direct ancestors. I perform such pieces not only as a counterpoint to the acts of upper-caste appropriation and stewardship, but also to acknowledge the deep levels of mediation through which I myself have received the very practice of Bharatanatyam, across the deep vectors of reform discourse, aesthetic refashioning, and moral and cultural nationalisms. 
Built upon the thematic of courtly love, as opposed to nationalist neo-Hindu devotional modes, my reclaiming of my community’s repertoire, asserts old familial genealogies into the dystopic spaces of capitalism where today’s corporate-funded “classical” dance thrives for the upper-castes. I perform dance compositions that were created or revivified for the new elites by hereditary dance-masters (nattuvanars) in my family – except that now, I perform these through my Bahujan body."" 

""Moreover, my performance is also rooted in my contemporary anti-caste stance through the inherited, distinctly modern vocabulary of the reinvented Bharathanatyam, shifting our focus away from the nationalist, religious content that dominates public representations of the art today. Through these interventions ,I hope to challenge basic understandings of the history and social constitution of Bharathanatyam as a corporeal and cultural practice.""","The artist's work is a powerful reclamation of traditional Bharatnatyam, reimagining it through an intersectional lens. By drawing from oral histories and moving away from fixed categories like nationalism and devotion, the artist politicizes the form. The interaction between the two female bodies on stage is particularly striking, fostering a sense of solidarity and community. This performance challenges traditional gender roles and beauty standards, celebrating diverse bodies and voices. By centering intersectional identities and breaking norms, the artist creates a space for historically marginalized  body, community, and their perspectives within the realm of classical Indian dance.

Adaption of three poems by Esther Syiem",Theatre storytelling,,Theatre,20 Minutes 30 Seconds ,"Theater artist Lapdiang Syiem's performance ""Reach out to grasp roots - I stand uprooted"" is an adaptation of Esther Syiem's poems, centered around the myth of U Thlen. This powerful piece delves into the devastating impact of coal mining on the region, weaving together three interconnected stories: the myth of U Thlen, the tale of a mother and her dying child, and the reemergence of U Thlen in the modern context. By exploring the interplay of these seemingly simple characters, the performance reveals their profound metaphorical significance for our contemporary times. It highlights the destructive force of coal mining, which is consuming land, economies, and lives.","The artist's fluid performance challenges traditional gender roles and societal expectations. They question the gendered nature of the myth of U Thlen, exploring how the narrative might unfold if the character were female. Through their work, the artist seeks to share the lived experiences of marginalized communities and challenge the boundaries between the imagined and the real. By embodying diverse roles and emotions, they highlight the fluidity of identity and the power of storytelling to create empathy and understanding. The clothes they are wearing is sybolises the stories of women from rural Meghalya.",northeast,regional,nature,,"https://princeclausfund.nl/awardees/lapdiang-artimai-syiem

75,"Contempt - a legal theatre (8 February, 2018) | Blackbox, Ashoka University",Play,,Theatre,45 minutes (approx.),"Directed by Danish Sheikh, this play mixes stories from queer lives - and excerpts from court hearings on Section 377. The narratives are delivered by witnesses - and given the label of affidavits; in a way, it reimagines the dialogue between lawyers and witnesses but in a theatre setting. How does contempt as an emotive practice inhabit the lives of those within, and outside, the classroom?","The play has a wide applicability - as its performance has taken place in both university and theatre spaces. The use of both stage and the background screen projection allowed for parallel narratives to keep running. While keeping the legal dilemmas in the centre, it often breaks into poetic, philosophical musings as well: some of the audio narratives happen with no one on stage.",Contempt,Section 377,Danish Sheikh,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BBwJjnWHklNQVwpGuEOr5fAPJjAO3bb2/view,
