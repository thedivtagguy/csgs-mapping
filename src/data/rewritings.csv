"Not Limited by Time ft. Nrithya Pillai
Nattuvangam and Vocal: Ananthashree ",Dance,20 Minutes 46 Seconds ,"From Nrithya Pillai:
""I perform my Bharathanatyam to imagine new regimes of mobility and equity for women like me from the hereditary families that are the original custodians of the bharathanatyam tradition. A large part of this has to do with the retrieval – through largely oral sources– of dance repertoire of historical import that was created by and for my direct ancestors. I perform such pieces not only as a counterpoint to the acts of upper-caste appropriation and stewardship, but also to acknowledge the deep levels of mediation through which I myself have received the very practice of Bharatanatyam, across the deep vectors of reform discourse, aesthetic refashioning, and moral and cultural nationalisms. 
Built upon the thematic of courtly love, as opposed to nationalist neo-Hindu devotional modes, my reclaiming of my community’s repertoire, asserts old familial genealogies into the dystopic spaces of capitalism where today’s corporate-funded “classical” dance thrives for the upper-castes. I perform dance compositions that were created or revivified for the new elites by hereditary dance-masters (nattuvanars) in my family – except that now, I perform these through my Bahujan body."" 

""Moreover, my performance is also rooted in my contemporary anti-caste stance through the inherited, distinctly modern vocabulary of the reinvented Bharathanatyam, shifting our focus away from the nationalist, religious content that dominates public representations of the art today. Through these interventions ,I hope to challenge basic understandings of the history and social constitution of Bharathanatyam as a corporeal and cultural practice.""","The artist's work is a powerful reclamation of traditional Bharatnatyam, reimagining it through an intersectional lens. By drawing from oral histories and moving away from fixed categories like nationalism and devotion, the artist politicizes the form. The interaction between the two female bodies on stage is particularly striking, fostering a sense of solidarity and community. This performance challenges traditional gender roles and beauty standards, celebrating diverse bodies and voices. By centering intersectional identities and breaking norms, the artist creates a space for historically marginalized  body, community, and their perspectives within the realm of classical Indian dance.
Artist singing in between the performance was quite fluid.

Performer explores how contemporary dance practitioners can draw inspiration from the rich heritage of Natyashastra, a 2000-year-old text that outlines the principles of drama and dance. By examining the concepts of vyakta (the manifested) and a-vyakta (the unmanifested), the conversation investigates the nature of rasa (aesthetic emotion) and its ability to transcend physical limitations. The discussion also probes the role of ancestry in contemporary practice, questioning how to honor this heritage while pushing the boundaries of traditional forms. Ultimately, Rasasutra aims to challenge binary thinking and explore the fluidity of identity, movement, and expression in contemporary performance.","Fusion of forms, live electronica music, the whole performance was on rythm no words was there. The intreaction between the performer was intimate, the way body movement was changing with bhav and ras shows the fluidity of the human emotions. Using prop like mat form the narration of performance was stand out. Challenging the fixed boundries and forms notion and higlighting the idea of collabration.

कव्वाल साहब के पसीने छूट गए नाज़ वारसी से मुकाबला करने मे-Naaz Warsi Vs Rizwan Jafri,Qawwali,18 minutes 21 seconds ,"In a captivating qawwali competition, Naaz Warsi, a female qawwal, faced off against Rizwan Jafri, a male qawwal. The performance, held before a predominantly male audience, challenged traditional gender roles and expectations. The qawwals sang passionately about love in its various forms, and breaking the traditional form of sufi songs they are doing shayari in between. A captivating jugalbandi, or musical duet, between the two showcases their exceptional skills. Naaz Warsi's vibrant attire makes her stand out in the crowd, captivating the audience. The performance serves as a powerful platform for challenging traditional norms and promoting inclusivity through the art of qawwali.","This performance challenges the exclusionary practices prevalent in dargah spaces, where hereditary learning often restricts access to women and non-inherited performers. The outright prohibition of women Qawwals from performing at traditional sites is a systemic issue enforced through a code of conduct dictated by the heads of the shrine. This political rationale underscores the importance of their performances as a means to challenge patriarchal norms and demand equal opportunities for women in the qawwali tradition. By performing in unconventional settings and asserting their right to be heard, these artists are contributing to a broader movement towards greater inclusivity and gender equality within the cultural landscape.

Cities and Lovers  by Tirana Sengupta,Dance,6 Minutes 19 Seconds,"This performance centers on a female body who defies societal expectations, experiencing love, abuse, and resilience. In the video, the artist performs Bharatnatyam in a public space, blending poetry with storytelling forms. The artist dedicates this work to those who choose love over identities of caste, class, religion, and region, also addressing same-sex love within these stories. Through storytelling, the piece explores love in all its forms and how society uses violence and sectarianism to suppress it. This story is not limited to the experiences of cisgender women but also examines how rigid, violent, and unequal gender norms impact marginalized identities.






","Performing Bharatnatyam in a public space, rather than in an auditorium, challenged the set norms of how certain arts should be viewed. This piece makes the art form more accessible to the general public. The interaction between the artist and the audience was fascinating for us- esp the way in which the audience of mostly young males from the community stare at the performer with curiosity and the artist with her art look back to them with questions, in a funny way, weirdly. Yet, the woman artist is occupying and reclaiming public space and while also sharing her experience through conversation with her friend.

5 Minutes 27 Seconds","The performance ""Hum Jinns Parast,"" an Urdu phrase meaning embodying multiple identities or spirits, is a collaborative work by Maniza Khalid (poet), Tirna Sengupta (dancer), Ghania Siddiqui (director), and Talat Shakeel (sound designer). This piece explores the complex layers of identity within individuals and their efforts to reconcile them. The artists delve into the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals in a society where their identities are frequently marginalized. Words such as khabeeth, haram, besharami, and behudgi—terms used in Islamic culture to label and dehumanize LGBTQ+ individuals—are employed, while the performance broadens its scope to address society as a whole, not limited to any single religion. Through dance, music, and personal narratives, the creators challenge cultural norms and seek to redefine what it means to be ""normal."" 





","The artist challenges fixed boundaries within the performing arts by, for instance, performing Bharatnatyam on a terrace without classical music, thereby questioning the current political segregation of languages based on religion and region. The fusion of Urdu and Bharatnatyam is both unique and serves as a political statement against the polarization of the art form and its internal hierarchy. Through Urdu poetry and dancing to the rhythm of spoken words, sound in the film is used to explore and question how the Muslim community and society at large view the LGBTQ+ community.",Urdu+dance+challenging the religion+fusion+folks dance,NA,"Hum Jinns

Akshayambara (2015) | Sharanya Ramprakash & Dramanon,Theatre,90 minutes,"Directed by Sharanya Ramprakash, this Kannada play by Dramanon Theatre discusses how female sexuality remains a subject that has yet to gain traction. An experimental work that premiered in 2015, it deals with the construct of gender performance - and shows how a male artist in streevesha plays Draupadi while in a tradition-defying move, a woman is cast as the Pradhana Purushavesha of Kaurava. What happens to the interpretation of gender when a man plays the streevesha and the purushavesha is played by a woman? Who is the real woman and who is the real man? The play uses the form of Yakshagana as well as ‘modern’ theatrical methods that interrogate the idea of representation of the female body, and consequently the notion of ownership. ","The play strikes a beautiful conversation around bodies, female sexuality and the inversion of gender roles in Yakshagana. It supports what is increasingly a bigger presence of women artists in the dance form. Moreover, Akshayambara’s set includes a Yakshagana stage as well as a green room, both of which are onstage. Both these aspects are big reasons for why this can be selected as a 'queer' performance. The play’s narrative moves between stage and greenroom - and between vesha (costume) and vastava (reality) - thus raising questions to the spectator and their role in the play.

Chrysalis (2023) | Artrysis,Drag,NA. ,"Presented by Goa's Ryle Souto i.e. 'Artrysis', Chrysalis is a drag performance. Deeply evocative in nature, it is arguably about the author's queer journey, shown through wacking (dance) in a flower-styled costume - meant to signify 'growth' over time. It is about undoing the limitations and insecurities 'lined' within a body: and blooming in a new way, like a flower. ","Skanky and alternative in nature, it features avant-garde forms of makeup by the artist - and envisions body horror/fantasy in a new way; it is the latter element that possibly separates it from 'usual' drag. Like many drag shows that present queer or trans subjectivities in new ways, Artrysis's particular performance also does this in a playful yet disturbing way. Experimental and performance art in nature, it creates a beautiful blend of interesting form, props, makeup and dance. It is drag that horrors, astounds yet makes one think as an audience. Artrysis themselves see their drag and performance as reflexive: and adaptable to different venues. It is their politics as an indie artist which makes their selection worthwhile.","Drag, Artrysis, Horror, Experimental, Alternative art, Chrysalis, Camp, Performance art.","Drag shows are physical yet rarely digitized: same is the issue with this performance.

","The play features a mix of dance, drama and poetry in conveying its message, and its trance-inducing English narration creates an alternate effect on its audience. The very introduction of an alien dance format like ballet is also interesting in subverting the spectator's gaze. In an intricate play of light and sound, both male and female forms of sexuality and desire are explored through individual and group performances. The form also intermixes both Western classical, and Indian classical forms of dance.

The piece draws inspiration from the historical context of South Indian devadasis and North Indian tawaifs, marginalized courtesans who navigated lives filled with both sensuality and social exclusion. Loosely based on Jean Genet's The Maids, Frenemies weaves together intimacy and rivalry to reflect the struggles of these figures within a harsh material world. Johar describes the performance as embodying ""a lick, a bite, a jab, a sting, a sigh, and a song,"" combining these elements to depict a sensuous search for emptiness within the physical body (Johar, 2015).

However, it is the unconventional act of re-enacting a movie for audiences who wouldn't commonly have access to cinema is what makes the form of the performance as queer as the identities involved.

He goes on to perform to the thumri 'Tum Radha Bano Shyaam'. The first half of the performance is baith-ke-thumri, which refers to the use of abhinaya while sitting. The latter half showcases him performing. However, abhinaya remains at the forefront and he uses the body subtly to aid expression.","The initial narration introduces this performance as one exploring the androgeny of Krishna, ""Let us watch Krishna discover Radha within himself"". The lyrics of the Thumri translates to 'Become Radha, Krishna'. However, the unusual syntax of the lyrics evokes the dynamism of its meaning on the basis of 'tum's position. Who becomes who? A strand of Kathak can be traced back to 'Raas', maintaining the popularity of the figures of Radha and Krishna. This performance blurs the boundaries of gender between them, which only furthers the subversion studied by critics who observe queerness in the figure of Krishna.

"Alien Flowers', Sapphire Creations Dance Company ",Dance,"5 mins, 40 secs","Alien Flowers' was India's first LGBT dance production first staged in 1996. Choreographed by Sudarshan Chakravorty and featuring poems by Sanjay Vasa and Rakesh Ratti, this ballet dared to explore themes of queer identity and prejudice at a time when such topics were often relegated to the shadows. The clip showcases a recreation of the same performance eleven years after its premiere. ","The performance told the story of two men in love, battling society and its expectations. In 1996, it was met with audience uproar and critics calling it 'western-influenced'. Chakrabarty in an interview with Telegram mentions that performers carrying posters with the words 'celebrate your sexuality' were publicly harassed and the company received death threats. The same performance is revived in 2006 and applauded for its poetry and vision. Within the performance, contemporary dance and an interplay of expressions and bodily movements is used to narrate the story. Inventive props seem to behave like extensions of the queer body. Stepping past romantic cliches, love within the symbolic system of dance is reimagined. ","Dance, Queer",,https://youtu.be/2BLwizJxgdg,queering tradition
Trans/Generation' by Alok Vaid Menon,Spoken Word Poetry ,"4 mins, 34 secs","Performed at Unerase Poetry, this poem narrates the silent conflict between the poet's identity and that of their culture and family. ","the poet talks about how in their family, one mustn't smile for portraits. They say that not smiling is also an act of resistance. it also symbolises all the silences that stand between them. silence, they say, is violence. As they follow their life, very differently marginalised than their equally marginalised grandmother, they talk about the 'economy of rage' in their culture and the little respites and rushes that keep them alive.
