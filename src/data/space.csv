"Launda Naach , Folk dance Bihar",Launda naach,"लौंडा नाच भारत के बिहार यू.पी (पूर्वांचल) राज्य की एक प्रसिद्ध पारम्परिक लोक नृत्य शैली है जिसमें एक पुरुष कलाकार सुंदर स्त्री का वेश धारण कर नृत्य प्रस्तुत करता है !


Translation: Launda Naach is a famous traditional folk dance style of Bihar UP (Purvanchal) state of India in which a male artist disguises himself as a beautiful woman and dances. 

This piece performed by student Rakesh Kumar SD in National School of Drama, Delhi. The performer mixes the Launda naach with the song  ""Mehangai Dayan Khaye Jaat hai "" which presents class struggle by the song it is a critism of government and political power on mehngai. The costume that the artist has worn clothes which represents bihari culture and challenges the minimalism of upper class and caste aesthetics. In the last other folks from the audience joined him to perform with him and the hooting shows how people where resonating with the lyrics which is the reality of a lot of people in India currently. ","In this performance what stood out for us was how the artist and the audience intreactated with each other. From people joining the performer on stage; Four male-bodied individuals enjoying the performance with the artist who is also a male bodied person. This performance reclaims an urban and metropolitan city like Delhi where a regional art form and region like Bihar has been looked down upon. In the end,  many people join the artist and dance on the song which goes beyond sexualization and satirizes the government creating a sense of community. Historically this folk art form has been perfromed by oppressed caste people and the name change from naach to launda naach is a strategy used by the upper castes and classes of Bhojpuri society to demean a popular folk tradition associated with marginalized communities. This renaming, along with the substitution of 'Bidesiya' for Naach, serves to both stigmatize the art form and erase its complex themes of social critique.",Bihar+लौंडा नाच +भारत +बिहार यू.पी + challenge norms+artist+tradition+folk ,,Launda Naach by Rakesh Kumar,,
"Sadda Haq (2011) | Yaariyan | Queer Azadi March, Mumbai",Dance,5-6 minutes,"The words Sadda Haq means 'my right'. Sadda Haq was Asia's first queer flash mob that took place in 2011. It was held as part of Queer Azadi March, Mumbai, organized by Yaariyan. More than 50+ queer individuals came out, and danced to Bollywood songs, as a celebration and claim for queer freedom and equality in India. ","Most Youtube searches of 'queer performance india' often lead to videos of queer flash mobs - many organized by the organization Yaariyan themselves. This led me to Sadda Haq, the first such mob to happen in Asia.  A flash dance mob on queer issues - but importantly reclaiming public issues, and disrupting public movement to communicate queer questions - stood out to me. Being the first ever such event to be organized by India, and the first one by Yaariyan, contributed in making this an important queer performance. Short, funny and 'masala' in nature, the sheer abruptness of the mob was queer to me. Mixing different genres of songs, while simultaneously chanting anthems and slogans of queer identity, the celebratory nature of the mob was beautiful.

In line with queer performance theory, the play disrupts heteronormative structures, presenting gender fluidity not as an object of ridicule, but as a site of rich, lived experience. By allowing the Hijra community to be humanized and de-exoticized on stage, the play counters the historical erasure of such identities in mainstream representations.","Performing arts, Hijra, gender nonbinary, family dynamics, marginalization, Maharashtra, queer identity, community representation",The entire play is not freely accessible digitally. ,https://youtu.be/eaGm5YbnDS0?si=NXwfjCuVwZ2qmD1O    https://www.instagram.com/akankshabalrangabhoomi/?hl=en  https://www.facebook.com/aakanksharangabhoomi/?profile_tab_item_selected=mentions&_rdr  ,

Directed by Arvind Gaur and performed by the progressive theatre group, Asmita Theatre, it explores the various taboos and forms of discrimation faced by the community - through various short 'takes' by different troupe members, it highlights various queer issues - like those of harrassment in the name of 'fun', police discrimination and forced marriages . The play has also been published in many theatre books.","The performance has extensively taken place across the university and protest spaces - acquiring a radical nature of its own, reflective of the theatre group's politics. Having the nature of a flashmob, the street play broke traditional boundaries of stage and spectatorship, allowing the audience to absorb the intense dialogues on offer.

"Akash and Raktim, India's Best Dancer 2",Bollywood,"5 minutes, 11 seconds ","The contestants on this very popular reality tv dance show perform a sensuous duet on 'Lahu Muh Lag Gaya' from 'Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ramleela'. The song, which has cinematically been eternalised for its colourful expression of intimacy, love and sexuality, is presented unconventionally in this lyrical performance. ","Reality TV dance shows and such are very popular mediums in India. They are known as 'family entertainment', destined for audiences of all ages. For a sensual dance performance comprising of two men to be staged on such a platform itself is very unconventional. By maintaining the flamboyance, fearlessness and celebratory pride in this sensuality, queer love and intimacy is being portrayed far away from lenses of marginalisation. Following the use of colours in the original imagination of the song, this performance makes use of red gulaal that the dancers coat themselves and each other in. The colour red can be read for its duality in violance and desire. Either way, any semblance of otherness melts away under the sensual lyricism of the dance.

"Farewell Dance', Maitreyi College (DU)",Dance,"10 minutes, 5 seconds","This performance is uploaded by Priyanka Sehrawat on her YouTube Channel. The vlog comprises of performances staged at a farewell in Maitreyi College, a women's college in University of Delhi. The women, dressed in sarees, dance to popular 'item songs' in Hindi and Haryanvi. In the beginning of the vlog, they are seen bantering amongst one another, speaking about the farewell and college, and dancing to music while getting ready for the event. ","Women's colleges are a space where women feel free to reclaim their bodies, sensualities and sexualities. The same songs that objectify them outside of these walls, free them within. Farewells, which are organised more informally than bigger annual programmes, do not observe much interruption by administration. This makes freer space for expression. The first performance on a popular haryanvi song, features the performer dancing freely with joy. This unchoreographed performance is cheered on by an enthusiastic crowd of women. In the. latter performance, the performers dance to songs like 'chikni chameli' with sensuality and grace, smiling and laughing with one another as they go. This particular video has been chosen for more reasons than one. Many such performances are viral on social media, often accompanied by vulgar captions and titles that objectify these women who consented to performing before only a roomfull of women. This is one of the very few videos that are self uploaded by the performer. It reclaims the very act of performance. Including this in the archive also re-situates it politically in the spectrum of the internet.","Women's College, Dance",,https://youtu.be/sX9qLJEjUfE?si=AKPXH0bMlUjzRCBK,space
